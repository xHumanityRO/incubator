Incubator is a JForum based application which is a powerful and robust discussion board system implemented in Java. It provides an attractive interface, an efficient forum engine, an easy to use administrative panel, an advanced permission control system and much more. Built from the ground up around an MVC framework , it can be deployed on any Servlet 3.1 container or application server running at least on Java 8, such as Tomcat, Jetty and JBoss/WildFly. Its clean design and implementation make JForum easy to customize and extend.
