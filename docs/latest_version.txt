2.7.0

<p>This is a feature release for JForum. It includes the following improvements, amongst others:</p>

<ul>
<li>Banners can be shown at the top and the bottom of pages</li>
<li>Deleted posts can go into a designated "Trash Can" forum rather than be deleted outright</li>
<li>Missing translations have been added for a number of languages</li>
<li>The mobile view got a number of improvements: The Top Downloads, Member Listing and Moderation Log pages are now available, and site navigation is done via a dropdown menu that makes for a less cluttered interface</li>
<li>Eight new smilies :-)</li>
<li>Numerous bug fixes</li>
</ul>

<p>See <a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/jforum2/wiki2/NewFeatures270/">this page</a> for a full list of what is new and changed.</p>

<p>Everyone should upgrade, which involves running a fairly simple database upgrade script. A Servlet 3.1 container, like Tomcat 8, is now required.</p>
